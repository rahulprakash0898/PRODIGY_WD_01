        <p>Lord Rama, Treta Yug</p>
        <p>Rama was the seventh avatar of God Vishnu. Lord Rama is a commonly worshiped avatar in Hinduism, and is thought of as the ideal heroic man. His story is one of the most widely read scriptures of Hinduism, the Ramayana.
            While in exile from his own kingdom with his brother Lakshman for 14 years and the God Hanuman, his wife Sita was abducted by the demon king of Sri Lanka, Ravana. He then traveled to Ashoka Vatika (or vanam) in Lanka, killed the demon king and saved Sita.</p>

    <p>Lord Krishna, Dwapara Yuga</p>
        <p>Krishna was the ninth avatar of Lord Vishnu. Lord Krishna was the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudev. He is widely worshiped deity in Hinduism and an avatar in Vaishnava belief. He appeared alongside his elder brother Balarama. Balarama is regarded generally as an avatar of Lord Vishnu.
            However Balarama is included as the eighth avatar of Vishnu in the Sri Vaishnava lists, where Buddha is omitted and Krishna appears as the ninth avatar in this list.</p>
